## Features

The product developed as part of this project has the following features:

1. **Data Scraping and Collection Pipeline**: This feature is responsible for collecting data from Telegram channels.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation Pipeline**: This feature cleans the collected data and transforms it into a suitable format for further analysis.

3. **Object Detection using YOLO**: This feature uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection in images.

4. **Data Warehouse Design and Implementation**: This feature involves the design and implementation of a data warehouse to store and manage the collected data.

5. **Data Integration and Enrichment**: This feature integrates the data from various sources and enriches it for better analysis.
